# Crit Findings Log

### Crit dates:
1. October 3
2. October 31
3. November 14

### Summarized feedback from Crit Group

• The transition from Smart Home into nursing homes still isn't clear presentation-wise

• Focus on one aspect and do it well (e.g. strongly focusing on the sensor that detects bathroom visit count)

• Since we have one nursing home that:
1) is interested in what we're building and;
2) expressed their need in it, then focus on them. Get them to contribute if they can throughout development

### Summarized feedback from Greg Pass

• Considering the broadness of “Smart Homes”, it is necessary to pick a particular subset of products and possible users.
• The choice of product (sensor kit to monitor behavior + platform to combine data) and user segment (nursing homes) seems to be right, addressing a mapped need.
• Risk: only one possible client was addressed. More research is required
• Next steps:
  1)	Reach for more nursing homes to confirm demand
  2)	Reach for doctors to confirm technical/clinical relevance of information
  3)	Reach for possible final clients to evaluate possible aversion to data collection
