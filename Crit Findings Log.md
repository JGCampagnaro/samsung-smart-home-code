### Summarized feedback from Crit Group

• The transition from Smart Home into nursing homes still isn't clear presentation-wise

• Focus on one aspect and do it well (e.g. strongly focusing on the sensor that detects bathroom visit count)

• Since we have one nursing home that:
1) is interested in what we're building and;
2) expressed their need in it, then focus on them. Get them to contribute if they can throughout development
