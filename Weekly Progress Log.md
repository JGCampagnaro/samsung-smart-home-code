  - Clarified deliverable expectations with J McLoughlin and Leland Rechis.
  - After Sprint, we revisited previous work and tried to clarify the “why” for our proposed solution. We diverged to generate new ideas individually and converged to prepare a pitch deck for company advisor. 
  - Call conference with Bill, going through all of our ideas and filtered down to 4 ideas (#3, #4, #6, #7).
  - Got further advice and directional guidance from Deborah, which led the team to settle for #4: Nursing Home.
  - Created an architecture diagram.
  - Created team/code Github Repo: Linked “Development Process” and  “Goals” to the repo.
  - Reached out to people in related industries to have a better understanding of the area.
  - Followed up with the team from Hebrew Home in Riverdale.

#### Week Ahead
  - Research on nursing homes: familiarize with the market, and the condition of nursing homes.
  - Visit nursing homes/senior centers to learn about what they need and what might be useful for the elderly.
    - Schedule a visit with Hebrew Home in Riverdale
    - Schedule a meeting with Mark Steven Lachs
  - Create high level schedule for the activities and developments required up to the next Sprint.

#### Key learnings and actions from weekly retro
  - The demo we presented in Sprint was too minimal to demonstrate our ideas, needs more development to  elaborate our ideas.
  - The presentation narrative lacked the how and why we narrowed down to nursing home. 

#### Risks
  - The development process schedule might not work out as described due to volatile schedules.
  - Our target customer (nursing homes) might be hard to work with; need to gain trust and access to nursing homes.
  - Running short in time


## Week 3
#### Week Behind:
  - Met with Greg Pass (our studio advisor) and got critical insights on how to filter through our ideas for our product solution.
  - Interviewed with a number of people to learn about why would they or would they not purchase smart home devices 
  - Went back to the drawing board and developed 5 different ideas that we explored at the Sprint.
  - Debated on the ideas to yield which would be a best fit and deliberated with Deborah Estrin, in order to get feedback and a new set of eyes on our solutions. 
  - Developed a new narrative out of the idea that we decided on pursuing, two user stories and an initial pitch presentation which we presented on Sprint conclusion.
  - Received the CSP-EC agreement from Bill.

#### Week Ahead:
  - Work on clearing our idea further and gather additional supporting arguments.
  - Improve our sprint presentation based on feedback received.
  - Schedule a phone call with Bill, to discuss our new solution and dig into our next steps.
  - Add more information and details to the product demo to better explain our idea.
