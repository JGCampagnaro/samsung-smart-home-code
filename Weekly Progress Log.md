  - Clarified deliverable expectations with J McLoughlin and Leland Rechis
  - After Sprint, we revisited previous work and tried to clarify the “why” for our proposed solution. We diverged to generate new ideas individually and converged to prepare a pitch deck for company advisor. 
  - Call conference with Bill, going through all of our ideas and filtered down to 4 ideas (#3, #4, #6, #7) 
  - Got further advice and directional guidance from Deborah, which led the team to settle for #4: Nursing Home
  - Created an architecture diagram
  - Created team/code Github Repo: Linked “Development Process” and  “Goals” to the repo
  - Reached out to people in related industries to have a better understanding of the area
  - Followed up with the team from Hebrew Home in Riverdale

### Week Ahead
  - Research on nursing homes: familiarize with the market, and the condition of nursing homes
  - Visit nursing homes/senior centers to learn about what they need and what might be useful for the elderly
    - Schedule a visit with Hebrew Home in Riverdale
    - Schedule a meeting with Mark Steven Lachs
  - Create high level schedule for the activities and developments required up to the next Sprint

### Key learnings and actions from weekly retro
  - The demo we presented in Sprint was too minimal to demonstrate our ideas, needs more development to  elaborate our ideas
  - The presentation narrative lacked the how and why we narrowed down to nursing home 

### Risks
  - The development process schedule might not work out as described due to volatile schedules
  - Our target customer (nursing homes) might be hard to work with; need to gain trust and access to nursing homes
  - Running short in time
