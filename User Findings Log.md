# User Findings Log

### User Findings(09/29/17)

##### DAY: Sep 29th
##### PLACE: Hebrew Home at Riverdale
##### TALKED TO: David Finkelstein (Chief Information Officer)
##### MAIN REMARKS:
- Hebrew Home was already looking for a integrated “Smart Home” system over the past year.
- They approached several companies, including Samsung, but no one was able to provide the integrated platform as a service accompanied with the data collection that they need.
- Their institution provides several different services:
  - Short term rehabilitation of patients after an array of hospital procedures/ health conditions.
  - Care for dementia pecients
  - Enriched live care
  - Care for elderly individuals with special diseases.
  - Assisted Living.
  - Independent Living.
- The best implementation of Smart Products that they see is particularly focused on the Independent Living sector, which has less restrictions due to regulations in place (non-medical care) and for the same reason is more suptable to health sitution occuring.
- They focus on 2 main Smart Home features:
  - Safety/Security
    - Pad to detect # time out of bed
    - Pad to monitor vitals such as breathing and heart-rate when in bed.
    - Amenities access (refrigerator, outdoor activities)
    - Ability to request assistance both non-emergency and emergency within the home.
  - Clinical
    - Blood pressure data
    - Pill box access logs
    - Oxygen levels data
    - An array of health data gathering devices.
- They need a service that could collect the data from the devices, eventually analyse the results and indicate what actions must be done in case by case.
- Most of the devices already exist, but manufacturing companies do not engage on analyzing data and providing insight for them.
- The “data center” analyzing companies do not provide the sensor network
- As a prediction of the future, they believe in Telemedicine, where doctors could evaluate patients remotely, issues persist in how to charge for services in urban areas - rural areas are already implementing it in some sort of degree.

### User Findings(10/11/17)

##### DAY: Oct 11th
##### PLACE: Weill Cornell
##### TALKED TO: Dr. Mack S. Lachs
##### MAIN REMARKS:
 
- Strongly supports the idea and its application within nursing homes (independent living)

- “Physical aids (assistants) are better in predicting patient sickness compared to doctors”

- Elders prefer no human assistants as it costs and its embarrassing

- Know that the process of getting sick is different in elders compared to youngsters/adults

- Most startups that deal with this field fail because they think they know what the elders need (e.g. ideas like Skype, 100 mile track etc.). They’ve even experimented with XBOX motion detection.

- Basic activity and movements (young and adults often take for granted) are key factors that are indicative of looming sickness or death.
- Activity includes: frequency of movements, time to get to point A to B (could be corridor), bed mobility*, morning setup**, eating duration, transferability.*** For example, change in walking speeds can be indicative of death

  *preventing bed sores, also a tech that’s currently implemented in Hebrew home   
  **greeting, brushing teeth, face wash etc.  
  ***ability to move from the bed to the chair and vice versa, is it completed independently or does it require 1 or 2 people?

- Based off the preliminary TMP (timed manual performance) test that tests manual performance as a predictor of death in the elderly community. It was found our that the slower it took the elders to complete the test, the higher the death rate.

- Common sickness predicted are: pneumonia and UTI

- In terms of frequency threshold (when to alert), it depends on each individual elder, anything that deviates from the norm

- With a huge quantity of elders, the system would benefit nursing homes as there is only that much attention given at a certain period
It also would benefit insurance, banks, providers, nursing homes, families

  - Insurance: a more accurate package plan  
  - Bank: provides more accurate prediction for reverse mortgage: you pay the elders that are expected to die so you can own their property 
  - Providers: saving on hospitalization costs  
  - Nursing Homes: better facility and service  
  - Families: Safety & Security  

- We were told to refer to “Care at Hand” service where they used Dr. Lachs research paper determining highly predictive factors for looming sickness in adults.

- He doubts the capability of Samsung’s devices in terms of sensitivity and quality of data. Would prefer a more tailored activity monitoring system like Fitbit technologies.

- Got in contact with Janey Peterson, who is a PhD student in nursing that is interested in actigraphy and has existing data we can work off from

- Dr. Lachs didn't focus on what he wants to see (insights or anything along that line) as a doctor, rather he wishes that the system would prevent hospitalization or sickness manifestation in the first place
