### User Findings(09/29/17)
#### Visit Report:
##### DAY: Sep 29th
##### PLACE: Hebrew Home at Riverdale
##### TALKED TO: David Finkelstein (Chief Information Officer)
##### MAIN REMARKS:
- The Hebrew Home is already looking for a integrated “Smart Home” system for over 1 year
- They approached several companies, including Samsung, but no one was able to provide the integrated service that they need
- They provide several different services:
  - Short term rehab
  - Care for dementia pecients
  - Enriched live care
  - Care for especial diseases conditions
  - Assisted Living
  - Independent Living
- Their focus on Smart Products is focused on the Independent Living sector, that has less restrictions due to less regulation (non-medical care)
- They focus on 2 main Smart Home features:
  - Safety/Security
    - Pad to detect # time out of bed
    - Pad to detect breathing/heart rate
    - Amenities access (refrigerator)
    - Gate sensor
  - Clinical
    - Blood pressure
    - Pill box access
    - Oxygen levels
- They need a service that could collect the data from those devices, analyses the results and indicate what actions must be done
- Most of the devices already exist, but manufacturing companies do not engage on analyzing data for them
- The “data center” analyzing companies do not provide the sensor network
- As a prediction of the future, they believe in Telemedicine, where doctors could evaluate patients remotely (issues regarding how to charge for services)
