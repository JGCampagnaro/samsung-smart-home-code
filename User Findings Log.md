#### Visit Report:
##### DAY: Sep 29th
##### PLACE: Hebrew Home at Riverdale
##### TALKED TO: David Finkelstein (Chief Information Officer)
##### MAIN REMARKS:
- Hebrew Home was already looking for a integrated “Smart Home” system over the past year.
- They approached several companies, including Samsung, but no one was able to provide the integrated platform as a service accompanied with the data collection that they need.
- Their institution provides several different services:
  - Short term rehabilitation of patients after an array of hospital procedures/ health conditions.
  - Care for dementia pecients
  - Enriched live care
  - Care for elderly individuals with special diseases.
  - Assisted Living.
  - Independent Living.
- The best implementation of Smart Products that they see is particularly focused on the Independent Living sector, which has less restrictions due to regulations in place (non-medical care) and for the same reason is more suptable to health sitution occuring.
- They focus on 2 main Smart Home features:
  - Safety/Security
    - Pad to detect # time out of bed
    - Pad to monitor vitals such as breathing and heart-rate when in bed.
    - Amenities access (refrigerator, outdoor activities)
    - Ability to request assistance both non-emergency and emergency within the home.
  - Clinical
    - Blood pressure data
    - Pill box access logs
    - Oxygen levels data
    - An array of health data gathering devices.
- They need a service that could collect the data from the devices, eventually analyse the results and indicate what actions must be done in case by case.
- Most of the devices already exist, but manufacturing companies do not engage on analyzing data and providing insight for them.
- The “data center” analyzing companies do not provide the sensor network
- As a prediction of the future, they believe in Telemedicine, where doctors could evaluate patients remotely, issues persist in how to charge for services in urban areas - rural areas are already implementing it in some sort of degree.
